This is a small application which builds a "QuickLook generator" for Mac OS.
This will generate previews (selecting a file in Finder and hitting space) and
thumbnails ("Cover flow" view in Finder) for .obj, .off and .mesh 3D model
files.

To build issue:

    make

This will compile the source and build the application in ./Mesh.qlgenerator/

To install issue:

    sudo make install

This will copy the directory ./Mesh.qlgenerator/ into /Library/QuickLook/ and
reload the Quicklook Manager (so that you see your changes in Finder).
