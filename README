This is a small application which builds a "QuickLook generator" for Mac OS.
This will generate previews (selecting a file in Finder and hitting space) and
thumbnails ("Cover flow" view in Finder) for .obj, .off and .mesh 3D model
files.

To build issue:

    make

This will compile the source and build the application in ./Mesh.qlgenerator/

To install issue:

    sudo make install

This will copy the directory ./Mesh.qlgenerator/ into /Library/QuickLook/ and
reload the Quicklook Manager (so that you see your changes in Finder).

= Dependencies =

Install Mesa3D using macports. 

    sudo port install mesa

Then re-install GLU Ã  la http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=2827

= Testing =

After installing you can test previews with:

    /usr/bin/qlmanage -p ../shared/cheburashka.off

and thumbnails with:

    /usr/bin/qlmanage -t ../shared/cheburashka.off

= Note about Mesa =

If things look weird (too far away, blank, etc.) then maybe you should
reinstall GLU. It seems that the version of GLU that comes with macports' mesa
is buggy/corrupted.
